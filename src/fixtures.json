    "content": "1976, the bicentennial of our nation’s founding. To celebrate the year the U.S.A. was emblazoned in red, white, and blue from sea to shining sea, the Ringling Brothers circus was no exception. What a spectacular sight for my first time to see a circus in person. It was a red, white, and blue explosion. The decorations, the costumes, both the people and the animals. It was a real sight to behold. So much to see. The trapeze artists, the tightrope walkers, jugglers, horses, tigers, elephants, lion tamers. My memory is a little fuzzy, but I seem to think there were also some camels, goats, and llamas. I honestly can’t recall it all. One of the most memorable for me was the clowns. The fire brigade of clowns, and the clown car, which seemed like it would never empty. I laughed so hard at their hijinks. I remember a stilt walker dressed as Uncle Sam on a dangerously high pair of stilts. I still remember the tiger act. A fellow named Gunther Williams was the tiger guy. His act was really impressive, and the elephants were so cool. But the circus is more than just what you see, it’s also the sounds. The trumpet of the elephants, the roar of the lions, the sound of the horses, the band music, and the calliope. To this day I’ll still stop to listen to calliope music whether it’s the circus or on a steamboat, just love that sound. The show was constantly on the move. The sights, sounds, action. They packed a lot into the show. They put in a lot of effort to entertain the crowd and entertain they did. They didn’t call it “The Greatest Show on Earth” without a reason.",

    "excerpt": " “Men don’t cry,” he scolded me, “you look ridiculous.” I was six. Over the years, I forgot how to cry or maybe my tear ducts were simply sealed from lack of use, now I’m not even sure I’m capable.",
    "content": "“Men don’t cry,” he scolded me, “you look ridiculous.” I was six. Over the years, I forgot how to cry or maybe my tear ducts were simply sealed from lack of use, now I’m not even sure I’m capable. Congenital. Nothing to be done. The sooner the better. “Two weeks max,” tuna breath explains as if he’s ordering lunch, “what are some of his favorite things?” “Beach, chasing squirrels, hot dogs, and sleeping on my bed,” I tell him as I rub Buddy’s head. “Everything but the squirrels.” tuna breath explains as he hustles out of the room, “Make an appointment for two weeks with the receptionist.” Well, fuck you very much, I think to myself as I scoop Buddy up in my arms and place him gently back on the floor. I feel my eyes burn, and I fight against it, the same way I have since my father pulled me by the ear when I was six. I rescued Buddy, (Short for Budweiser) half Benji/half Lassie when I got my first off-campus college apartment. As a pup, he was all paws and eyelashes and hopped like a bunny when he got excited. He refused to be left alone and often followed me into the shower, shivering but with a watchful eye from the corner of the tub. Walks were a full-body workout. Clearly born with strong run-in-open-pastures DNA– I once found him 4 miles from our house after chasing a car halfway across town. Then. Then he stopped running, He was winded quickly, even while merely walking. The day I had to carry him home from the park I made an appointment with the vet. Now, I regret everything. See, I know I am a bad dog owner. I am selfish–skimpy five-minute walks after being gone all day soon. I am inconsiderate–too cheap to buy anything but the bulk generic dry dog food. Buddy holds nothing against me. He sees something in me I simply don’t believe exists. I often wish I could be the man he thinks I am. It feels like something is stuck in my throat as I tell myself, no, I promise myself, I WILL be that man for him in his final couple of weeks. That night. He’s resting at the foot of my bed– watching I don’t disappear. His breathing becomes choppy and labored. The look on his face scares me enough that I rush him to another white sterile room while wearing two different shoes. Dr. Pretty Face doesn’t smell as if she had tuna for breakfast, lunch, and dinner this whole week. She assures me Buddy won’t suffer, but that the time is upon us. She hand-feeds Buddy peanut butter snacks from her pocket. Buddy, even on his deathbed, ravages them as if protecting them against foreign invaders. Two needles, one clear and another with a blue cap. Pretty Face tells me the first is for the pain. Into the catheter. Buddy’s whole body unclenches. Peace swims over his face. Does he know? I wonder. Pretty Face is a clairvoyant, “He understands. Say your goodbyes, I’ll be back in a minute” She gently squeezes my shoulder as she walks past. I bend to kiss his dry nose. His bushy eyebrows twitch as he nuzzles into my shoulder. He is free of suffering; the only pain left is my guilt. I whisper that he is a good dog, the best goddammit, and he will be chasing squirrels in heaven soon. I think I see his tail trying to wag, but I can’t be sure of anything anymore. “This one will stop his heart.” The vet explains. I nod as I fight back the ancient tears that have welled up inside of me for over a decade. “Stay still, Buddy.” I whimper, and for once, he obeys. I close my eyes as the needle goes in– three years young, in his chasing prime, strong and brave; the food stealer, the midnight silent farter, the howler in the storm– that’s how I will remember him. I step into the dark empty parking lot and stuff his dog tags deep into my pocket. I toss his leash and collar into the large, green trash bin by the door. I sit in my car, something primitive breaks, and the dam bursts. My body remembers everything.",

Thus it’s hope– That clever demon, Lurking in my chest, Never giving me any rest. Endless thoughts plague me anon Till I awake from these dreams, I wonder, Can they even hear me scream",

    "content": "When I remember to look out, I can see the circus of this place I’m living in. When I remember to look outside of myself. I get caught up in the voices and angst inside my mind and body. The parade of thoughts and desires left inside. The circus I'm in is second-rate. Nothing runs on time and our laughs are cynical like we get a kick out of the freaks. It’s dark to laugh at people who were born disfigured. At least I didn’t pay to get in. I’m better than that. Honestly, I thought about it and realized that I’m a part of the circus too. An abused beast, coaxed into submission, waiting for the next moment I can perform since it gets me out of my cage. I’ve learned a few tricks over the years; like when it’s better to smile or to snarl. The crowd still loves a little bravado once in a while. Even the ringmasters, with all their power, like a challenge, keeps things interesting enough for the audience to want more of you. Even though we all know I’m well-trained, Icould still bite. I love chaos mixed with orders. Each unplanned moment unfolds in the confines of radio traffic and schedules. This happens before that and that before this, every day, the order to father time. The circus is aloof to the time I spend locked in my cage. It goes on and on, each performance taking center stage, the drama in the spotlight, whether I bite or I smile, play my tricks, or get wild like I used to be. I’m in control. I play my part. I roar and I purr within the invisible lines of my training within the walls of the home that someone else chose for me, dreaming of the jungle, where they found me.",

    "content": "The experience of being here in prison over time stretches the growing space between my family and myself. A space that will never shrink no matter what I try to do I don’t see myself as being changed but reformed this experience has shaped the way I view reality and the reality of who and what I am. The concept of home for me changed from address to people. The most valuable thing for me is human intimacy. I don’t miss things I miss people I miss our shared connection and experiences. This time away has changed or in some cases broken that connection. when we experience new challenges, especially traumatic ones we tend to change our relationships with people who cannot or will not be able to relate. The more challenges I faced in life the bigger my space has grown around me and the more I deflect away people who never faced my reality. Your average adult in the world might have faced their share of crisis in their life, many see themselves as being wronged or victimized, yet very few see themselves as the author of their very own tragedy. when one sees that they are the author of their life good and bad, it’s easier to accept reality and make a better future for themselves. The past doesn’t haunt me anymore I accept it as who I am, yet I am more than the good or bad, I am not just the person living in my own space I am the space around me as well.",

    "content": "Being the youngest in a family full of boys meant I played every sport and learned every skill a boy could. I also had to make good grades. I was my father’s last-ditch effort at glory, and at fulfilling his unrealistic expectations. in light of the failures of my older brothers. Run faster, shoot straighter, jump higher, hit harder, plow through that line, and don’t you dare cry. Boys don’t cry! You’re hurt? Rub some dirt on it! But no matter how hard I tried, it was never enough. The son of a retired military man does not fail. Win at all costs. Losing is not an option. No one loves a loser. I brought home a report card with a C in English. It wasn't my favorite class to begin with, so I sat in the back. Not like math and science where I sat in the front row. The sealed note enclosed said I had, “become lazy,” didn’t answer questions any more, and refused To read when called on. “I know he can do better.” Father knew how to fix this. A reading lesson of sorts. I grabbed my English book and joined him in the backyard where he sat in a lawn chair, watching my brothers play basketball. “Read,” he growled. “What?” I asked. “Anything.” I picked the story we started in class about the kid who tricked his friends into painting his Aunt’s fence, while he ate apples. He made me stand a step in front of him on his right, facing forward. I started to feel anxious and embarrassed as my brothers laughed. I opened to the page we stopped on in class and began to read aloud. The first word I misread was “tranquilly.” I had a hard time saying R and Q. I worked with the speech teacher for an hour on Fridays, while the other kids got to play kickball. “Read it again!” he yelled. I winced at his intensity. Why was he screaming at me? I read the sentence again. I got the Q right, but the R came out as “twanquilly” Out of the corner of my left eye, I saw my father unbuckle and remove the belt holding up his trousers. He doubled it over and held it in his right hand. “DO IT AGAIN!” he shouted. I couldn’t understand why he was so angry. I knew what the word meant, I just had trouble saying it. I also knew exactly what a belt held like this was used for. I stood trembling, book shaking, taking my time to sound out every word, carefully ensuring I did not mess up again. When I got to the period I looked over at him, “Continue,” he snapped. I don’t know what the next word I messed up was. Panic-stricken and fearful of making a mistake, I started scanning ahead to look for troublesome words. In my manic confusion I must have mispronounced or skipped a word because, without warning, the next thing I felt was a searing sting on my thighs - thankfully above the edge of my cutoff jean shorts. The impact was so strong, I had to take a step forward to keep from falling.“AGAIN!” My brothers stopped playing to point and make faces as I read the sentence again, feeling like my life depended on me not screwing up. When I got to the period this time I just kept going. I didn’t give a fuck about Tom or Aunt Polly or that goddamn fence any more. All I wanted to do was finish the chapter so I could go back inside. “Alacrity” was the next word I missed. I had no idea what it meant, or why Tom had it in his heart. But I knew I had gotten it wrong, and what was coming. The snap of leather on bare skin makes a very distinct, unforgettable Sound. I guess he felt the first blow didn’t make enough of an imprint, because this one arrived below the edge of my shorts. I missed three more words before finishing the story - same punishment. My audience stopped laughing. Even when I pissed myself. I vividly recall the feel of it running down my leg and puddling around my bare feet. The basketball game dissolved, and my siblings scattered, afraid they would be next. Leaving me and my collection of backside welts alone with my father, the pile of empty beer cans beside him, and his teacher’s aide. I remember looking up at some point towards the kitchen. window that overlooked our backyard, desperately searching for my mother to rescue me. She just stood statuesque at the sink, peeling potatoes or carrots or some other mundane kitchen chore. Tears streaming down her cheeks, knowing that if she interfered, his attention might turn to her. When I was done, he asked, “I’m not going to receive any more notes from your teacher about being lazy, am I?” “No Sir.” I managed to get out between sobs and snorts, trying not to collapse. “Good! Cause I’d hate to have to have any more of these reading lessons. Don’t you agree?” “Yes sir.” “Well, I guess you’re not as dumb as she thought you were. Wash that piss off my patio and go clean yourself up.” I did as I was told, then ran into the bathroom to throw up. Mom followed. She wiped away her own tears while she helped me undress, and sprayed Bactine on my bleeding thighs. To this day, the smell of that shit makes me sick to my stomach. All I could say between my screams of agony was, “Why?” “It’s just his way, honey. It’s just his way,” was all she offered. I HATED reading after our lesson. I only read what was required to complete my schoolwork, and nothing else. It wasn’t until my sophomore year of college that I read anything for enjoyment. I turned to TV, movies, and - my savior - music, for my entertainment, and my solace. I hated my father for that day, and I hated even more that he made me hate reading. When my friends talked about the sci-fi and fantasy books they read; I had nothing to offer. When I found out later the reason for our lesson was because I’d embarrassed him. I stopped reading out of defiance. “Fuck him!” A week later my little league coach asked why I wasn’t catching the ball as well as I had at the start of the season. “I don’t know coach, I guess I just don’t see it until it’s too late.” Coach must have talked to mom, quietly, a few days later I saw the eye doctor and was issued a pair of glasses. I didn’t miss any more throws to second base after that. Miraculously, my English grade improved, once I could see the board from the back row. I received a trophy for most improved player that year. I received straight A’s. I did not receive any more notes from my teachers, or another word about reading lessons from my father, or an apology. Results don’t lie and, in his eyes, he had done nothing wrong. *I’d like to thank Vicki Hicks for giving me the courage to write this piece. You are an amazing writer.",

From the start I was challenged daily by all the drugs that are here and have been very fortunate that I was blessed with a strong will to turn them down, but it still is something I am challenged with overcoming on a daily basis. I have also been challenged with fighting, whether for a seat, or for being White, or just being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Like I said, I got a serious anger problem and been challenged numerous times with whether or not to use a rod; fan motor; or whatever on someone for being extremely disrespectful. I got to keep telling myself extra time isn’t worth it, and I cannot conform to what the prison system is trying to make out of me. Regularly, I am challenged with whether or not to be obedient. Do this, do that, rack up, take your lines down, stand or walk in a single file, etc,... Well, I am human and still have problems with being challenged in regards to following rules.

    "content": "The guard was looking at him from beyond the fence. 'You... get up and present yourself to the warden,' he said slowly and calmly. This guard was one of the better ones, he knew who was not quick to dehumanize the prisoners. The guard likely chose him so as to make a good impression on behalf of the other prisoners. Regardless, his nerves were now tight; he was on edge. The guard stood between the fence and the warden to his right. The others crowded around to observe. He got up and presented himself, and the atrophy beginning to take his body was presented as well. He was glad to be standing next to the tree trunk used as a fence post. It allowed him to make sure he stood up straight. The smell of the wood also kept him focused in the moment; the earthy perfume still strong from the wire being regularly dug into its bark. Being underfed, especially without enough protein, can make a man's head fuzzy; make him float. The warden studied him for what may have been the longest minute of his life. He was not a tall man, and the most obvious difference between him and the others outside the fence was his glasses. 'Maybe they took him for a nerd, and decided he was the best man for the job without even testing his metal,' he thought to himself. 'Well, young man,' the warden finally spoke in a voice that stood out in no one's mind. 'What would you call this happy little place you find yourself in?' 'Summer camp, I guess,' he spoke back in a way that could have been a slight stupor or a beckoning sleep. This alarmed him more than it seemed to the warden, and he set about keeping it out of his voice. 'Hmm, yes. I guess that would be fitting. You certainly seem to be having fun sunning yourself. I'm so sorry we couldn't take you on a trip to the beach today. I know you boys were looking forward to it.” The warden said all of this in a way that sounded like he meant it. 'It sure ain't like it said it would be in the brochure,' he said in a slightly melancholic way, and he felt it. 'No, I guess we'll have to fire our writer,' the warden continued the charade. The other guards gathered around were starting to let a few snickers slip out. 'Now,' the warden paused, and seemed to draw himself up for a serious conversation. 'They say you can tell a lot about a man by looking at his shoes, but seeing as how your boots were issued to you, I suppose that won't do in this case.” More snickers. 'Instead, I want you to empty your pockets,' the warden spoke with a hint of authority. 'There's more than one way to glimpse inside a man's soul, I suppose.' He reached into his pockets with a slow hesitation. He pulled his closed hands out and opened them for the world to see. In his left hand was a small metal spoon issued by the prison. In his right hand was an officer's whistle. 'Does that whistle work?' the warden asked, a bit concerned. 'No, it's just for sentimental value,' he replied. He blew into it to show it was the truth. 'Hmm...,' the warden paused, and then he smiled. He turned to the others. 'You see? Food and memories! That is all they need! So long as we give them that, there is no need to worry about them causing problems! What say you, boy?' 'Yes,' he replied, and drew up a careful smile. 'I think we can manage on that.” This brought a harsh laughter from the group of guards. He knew they were wolves who saw him as a trembling lamb on display from the herd of sheep. That's all they were to these people. Not many had much respect for them as men, despite superficially addressing them as such. They were animals to be taunted. He knew that his spoon was valuable: it and many like it had dug a small tunnel out of the prison, and after polishing it could be used to send signal glares to the others. His whistle was also useful: once he removed the folded-up picture of his girl from inside, it would send signals from further away. As a young, well-trained officer not-too-weak from starvation, he was the best choice to lead the guards away to the north with his whistle. The others would then head south while they were distracted. He chose to be the distraction for the same reason he hadn't backed down from the warden: if you want to survive the prison, if you want to overcome those who dehumanize you, you do not become the beast they make of you; you must put on a brave face and stand your ground.",

As I look into the mirror, I stare my demise square in his eyes. Tears are afraid of my face, So my tears stream inside. To cause one’s own grief, Is to never gain relief. Spewing my struggles on paper Is my only form of release. I can only forgive myself If the one I’ve hurt forgives me first. I vowed to protect something I broke, And that’s what makes it worse.

I wake up in the morning and at 8:01 AM I’m pushing that button in my room cell to connect to the bubble officer to ask permission to have water sent to my cell. Although I hate my atmosphere with almost everything in me, shower time is one of my favorite times of the day or even the week. It wakes me up and prepares me for a day locked up and away from my loved ones. It gives me 15 minutes to myself. So as I’m under that hot water thinking about my life before prison I’m honestly glad I’m even able to take this shower. Due to choices in my life there were times I’d go a week or two or even three without a shower. Just running the streets, sleeping on park benches or parking garages. Or even being in medically induced comas from overdosing and waking up smelling like a caveman. It’s those memories that cross my mind when I finally come back to reality and look out across the dayroom and see my fellow inmates on the phones with their loved ones or cleaning the block. As I rinse off, I think about the time when I’ll be free again, but living a whole new kind of life and having my own shower, so I can day dream about having to shower in prison instead of not being able to shower. And I'll dry off and never forget the places I’ve been and where I came from!",

    "content": "Here in Camp Prisoney Land, humor is greatly appreciated. I like to imagine people find me amusing. My wit and deadpan delivery keep the women on their toes. When someone says, “Catherine, you are so funny”, I don’t know how to interpret that. What do they mean? Catherine, you are so funny, you’re the life of the party, or Catherine you're so funny, but please don’t sit next to me on public transportation. In any event, my dry sense of humor must bow in the presence of greatness. And by bow, I don’t mean a curtsey, I mean all the way down, forehead to the ground. Leo, I am not worthy to touch the hem of your garment. The crown and scepter must be ceded to you. Clearly, in the throes of nominative determination, your parents named you appropriately. No question, you are the King of Comedy. I’ll just play the wacky gal pal sidekick. I must invite you to have a seat in my magic bean bag chair. First, you have to discard all your weapons, now strip off your armor. Boxers optional but encouraged. Climb in and get comfortable. Okay, I’m going to slip in next to you. Don’t squirm, this chair can accommodate two celibate asexual friends. Now let’s each roll slightly to the center so we can talk face to face and touch hands. Relax, your virtue is safe, at least from me. Feel the magic beans supporting you. Perfect! Hi friend! I’m being chased. All the girls want to read your pieces, “New York '' and “Shitty Story.” Sure they’ve been interested in PE stories here and there. I’ve only had the November issue for a few days. Already, it’s crinkled, welltraveled and full of smudgy fingerprints. Prisoney Land has hosted Russian models for human trafficking and drugs, a University of Florida cheerleader/gymnast who walked on her hands convicted for drugs and check fraud, and at least two sets of sexy twins, one set in for exploitation of the elderly and the other for armed robbery. There are also variegated strippers, call girls and a Palm Beach madame. Prisoney Land contains any woman you could dream up in the naughtiest chained heat fantasies. We use PE here to encourage women to read something other than People magazine and trashy urban sex novels. I clip the great pieces so they can be studied in the education department to guide students in how to write an essay or tell a story. For all writers of Prisoner Express, you guys are partners in teaching and encouraging others far beyond the sheets of this publication. The best results are when a new partner writer decides to join our PE club. Leo, these girls think I know you personally. I’m used to women approaching me to ask legal questions about programs. These past few days, it’s all what does he look like? Do you have a picture? Is he cute? Is he sexy? Is he single? I have to wade through them to get to my office where they can’t enter. Yesterday, I was in the communal bathroom when two girls in the stalls to the left and right of me pinned me down with more questions. I'm afraid to tell anyone I have a collection of back issues of PE with some of your work. They might stampede me. You are limiting yourself with ménage, you should be thinking harem. All teasing aside, thanks for such funny stories, partner. There is an African proverb which says “Until the lions learn to tell their story, the truth will not be known.” Thanks for telling your stories, Leo!

    "content": "I don’t know the staffing situations in other prisons or states, but news flash - London is transferring 750 inmates out for “remodeling.” This after they have shut down 4 blocks and transferred 450 out since August. Right now, we don’t know who all is going but the fun and festivities of 2.4ing out starts tomorrow. Since I don’t know about other states, I’ll explain what 2.4ing means. In Ohio, when you transfer from one prison to another they give you a box to pack all your belongings in. It’s 2.4 cubic feet of space. For a long-term offender, 2.4ing out is a bad experience because we tend to accumulate a lot of shit. Thankfully, I don’t have to worry about it because I’m minimum security and mostly medium security guys are going. If you have made it this far, you are probably wondering what the hell does this have to do with partners. It’s simple, really. The old school dudes call their homies, dudes etc. their partners. And I stand to lose a lot of partners. Very few people know who I really am. You guys reading my writings know more than the guys I live around. But for those few who do, it’s painful to lose them. When I rode in in ‘19, I had two partners I knew since ‘12 and one since ‘11, and made a friend for life who went home last December. Well now, it’s down to me and one partner. The good thing is that we easily adapt to any situation. I think that that’s what made me a good convict and has kept me sane. Shoutout to Leo Cardez for saying one of the truest things about prison friendships I have ever read: “It has turn my heart out and I have mourned more friendships than I care to remember, but, my only solace, I always keep the memories.” Just sitting here thinking about homies that have been transferred out, those released only to wind up dead, those possibly leaving hurts. I’m sure we have all seen the plaque, “live, laugh, love.” It’s enduring these situations that allows me to do so. But when I think of love, I think of it in the aspect of respect, loyalty, and camaraderie. Life here at London is about to change drastically over the next few months. 8 blocks closed and only 6 left open. They say it’s so they can remodel. But the truth is that they are 98 cops short. It’s hard to get cops for $18 an hour when the Target Warehouse pays $27 and Stanley Electric $23. And yes, this discounts and uproots a bunch of shit. But us convicts adapt. We’ll stay sane and carry on. Only 54 months left…",

    "content": "My two girls loved to cook and bake. Of course with that comes a big mess. As parents we clean up so many messes that we come up with any excuse as to why now is not a good time to use the kitchen. Nana would pick the girls up and take them to her house at least two or three times a week. She called it her quality time; mind you Nana is their greatgrandmother. Nana always had cake, brownie, or cookie mix at her house and if not, they are made from scratch. When Nana would bring them home there was always a cake with lots of icing dripping off of it. The girls would be bathed and had new clothes on. When I asked what happened to their clothes they simply said the mixer thing exploded and attacked us so we had to clean up our sticky mess that was all over the place. When I went over for a once a week deep cleaning of Nana’s house I would find a sticky mess under the cabinets, on the side of the refrigerator, on the ceiling, in the oven, on the floor, in the rug. They truly had an explosion of the mixer thing. Those days are gone, but will never be forgotten. Now I have a grand-daughter to bake and make a sticky mess everywhere with. I thank Nana for taking the time out of her life to teach my girls how to bake and enjoy life and not to worry about the sticky mess left behind.",

When she had to remove the tape the sticky business also removed a large part of her lip skin. Ouch! That was a one time only experience. My son’s story and sticky business experience happened at my workplace. I hear a scream and my five year old is running towards me holding his thumb up like he's chopped it off. When he reaches me I see there's an industrial staple buried in his thumb pad. I end up removing that piece of sticky business and doctoring his thumb. I then ask how in the world he had managed to staple his thumb. He quickly picks up the staple again and says “I pushed right here like this.” And… shoots another staple into his thumb. The second time was a learning experience. My son decided it was best to avoid such sticky business in the future.",

    "content": "I’m addicted–ahh, duh. No s--it Sherlock. To caffeine. This story really starts in the hills of Mexico, Columbia, or perhaps Brazil. Who knows; do we ever think about the origination of that which we love? Now I’m curious–I should check the yellow packaging of Keefe, the blue of Maxwell or the red of Folgers. What brand do I even purchase? It gets placed in my commissary order by an unseen fellow in khaki like me (the second-to-last pair of hands that touch my coffee; hands in a long line of underpaid hands.) So, back to where this all stems–a sun baked country (or do coffee beans grow in damp shadowed valleys at high elevations?). A wealthy land owner chooses the plants, inspects the soil, hires the workers–and watches them grow. Migrants, (are they called migrants if they’re native to their own land?) I guess, shamefully, I don’t really think about the broken-skinned, roughened hands that earn barely cents on the dollar to provide me with a cup ‘o joe each morning, any more than i think of a laborer in Thailand who might make the towels I dry off with, or the hands in China which assemble my MP3 player I listen to. And, do people even pick coffee beans anymore, or have corporate land barons replaced us with machines? Hmm, this is turning into less of a story on all those who help sort, package and ship; sitting idle at sea for a couple of months (hence recent inflation). They are then unloaded and driven somewhere else (according to the packaging I just inspected it’s done in St. Louis, no mention of anywhere south of the border). Finally it’s shipped by land-or maybe the Mighty Mississippi-(?)- stocked, inventoried and finally touched one last time as it’s sold to me-in prison. Each morning I awake, back stiff from a combination of age and a hard metal bunk that even my double-stuffed mattress cannot relieve, I open my locker, dump two generous scoops of finely ground powdery goodness into my plastic tumbler, add a scoop of cocoa, a crushed peppermint candy and a pink packet of generic sweetener, along with two-percent milk I’ve pocketed form the chow hall. Add scalding hot water–ahh, that first tentative sip. At that point, I know that my day is going to be all right. I actually hate the taste of coffee, thus explaining all the ingredients I add. I’m the guy who goes to Starbucks paying $5.00 a cup for coffee to taste anything BUT coffee. Today, I’m down to my last scoop, so I may have to beg until store day. More than anything, I hate asking for help. Interesting insight, if you don’t know me. If you do, hardly insightful. I’ve known this, for years now, to be one of my greatest defects of character. My ability to ask for help. I made a recent discovery about coffee. I was working on a recent Prisoner Express/Rattle poetry project–writing about something present–in the here and now that I could see right before my eyes. I chose my coffee mug at work. I started writing about its shape, color, size, texture; this morphed into a poem of hopefulnessdreaming of owning a coffee house- my way of honoring my mom, who loves her coffee. It would also be a way to always hold her close. Finally, my words revealed its true magic: coffee is the one thing I do for me. Alone. I’m not helping someone, fulfilling their needs, people pleasing, paying someone back, assisting, working for and so on and so forth. Coffee is my treat, alone time, which is why I do not like being interrupted just as I’m about to sit down with that one cup of java. It’s my shield that says, politely, leave me the f- -k alone. So that’s my story of coffee. My coffee. I could have written about awakening to a new life, better choice, sobriety, blah blah blah, and I truly DO look forward to reading the cornucopia of entries addressing healthier living having led to an awakening. As I draw to a close- and really, having nothing to do with coffee, I give you this commercial plug. I discovered an amazing book: “Writing to Awaken–A Journey of Truth, Transformation and Self Discovery” by Mark Matousek. For any writer, it’s a must have; for anyone who wants to grow emotionally, I say-get your hands on this book! It’s both a great way to sharpen your writing cleaver while digging deep. Okay, I’m done. Anyone have a shot of coffee I can bum ‘til store day?",

    "content": "Noise pollution: One of the deliberately unnoticed, and even less addressed, issues of prison life. After more than twenty-five years in various prison Units in Texas, the present building – and cell – assignment is the absolute worst. At 128 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 20 plus feet high, this concrete tunnel has become a fifty-one thousand cubic foot echo chamber. Within this tubular room, for fifteen to eighteen hours-a-day, are in excess of sixty male inmates (while there is seating for only forty) all competing to hear or be heard. One can only imagine the same room with the same number of female inmates, whose voices are higher and carry much, much further. Five telephones (thank you Securus® – though it would be nice to have noise-cancelling microphones) spaced roughly a yard apart are on the far back wall – one hundred and twenty feet from where the officer is usually perched – is also the noisiest location of all in this immense room – because of an eight-foot ceiling! Because of its distance from the desk, and far from the obstructed view of the desk (“quisnam custodiet ipsos custodies?”) most of the verbal (and sometimes physical) altercations take place there. It is also the smokiest. Inasmuch as there is also always one idiot (er…can’t find another synonym that is quite as accurate, so…) who wants to communicate – while also on the telephone – with his homey on the second row (there are two) at the opposite end of the room – even talking on the telephone twelve feet away is quite a challenge. Respect and control left this place years ago. Staff does nothing to keep the noise level down: dominoes slammed (for no apparent reason) onto stainless steel tables, six-inch homemade speakers on both televisions (at maximum volume, of course), the occasional order or calling/screaming/et cetera from staff, those inmates who feel that clapping and shouting at the televisions for their sports teams, and those who seldom have anything of any importance to say, unite to bring the noise level ever higher and higher. By the end of the day, even shouting is not loud enough – until some fool develops a public address system, that is. If OSHA were to be called in to check the noise level (as there are employees who are protected by law – ostensibly), this job would be condemned as being louder than that which is permitted in any industrial setting. As I try to speak to the man only two feet away, across the table from myself, or to my beautiful daughter on the telephone, I must often forcefully restrain myself from cupping my hands around my mouth, and shouting, “I said…!”",

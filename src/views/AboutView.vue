    <h1>About Prisoner's Express</h1>

    <p>Prisoner Express creates an opportunity for incarcerated men and women to get information, education and a public forum for creative self-expression. Through our newsletters and programs we step through the isolation and alienation of prison life â€“ our goal is to bring hope and foster a sense of community among the prisoners who participate.</p>

    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <p>Volunteers come in and read the prisoner's letters, sort through the essays, journals, poetry that prisoners have submitted, and then type and edit them.

    Then, theme essays and poetry are selected to be published in the next newsletter.

    Our vast database is also maintained by volunteers. We keep track of every interaction to make sure that individual prisoners are offered support and connection.

    Volunteers also correspond with prisoners who are active in our Journal Program. Our distance learning programming is created by volunteers who have interests and passions they wish to share. If you take a look at our older programs, you can see examples of the high quality work created by dedicated students and community members.</p>
